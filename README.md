# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
The Handwritten Character Recognition project used sklearn for dataset loading and train-test splitting. Matplotlib was employed for data visualization. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieved high accuracy in recognizing handwritten characters. The project aimed to develop a reliable system for character recognition using KNN.
